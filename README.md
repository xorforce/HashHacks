## High Spirits <br>
The project sends out 2-3 questions to the user throughout the day at random times. When the user prompts Alexa, the mood of the user is calculated on the basis of the answers of the questions asked earlier thorugh Cognitive APIs. Alexa then curates a Spotify Playlist according to the user's mood and sets the lighting of the room according to it.<br>
